# How VRCFaceTracking was ported to Linux (and macOS)

I've been using [VRCFaceTracking](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking) for quite some time now. At the time of writing this, the better part of 2/3 years.

I've seen its beginnings as a [mod](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking/releases/tag/v2.6.0), then a [console app](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking/releases/tag/v3.0.0), then a [Windows Form](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking/releases/tag/v4.0.0) and finally (and currently) a fully-fledged [WinUI3 application](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking/releases/tag/5.2.3.0). 

During this time, I have also seen the growth of VR on Linux. I understand [the majority of people who use VR  are on Windows](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey), and by extension users of social VR apps, myself included. I'm writing this on my 11-year old workstation I built back in 2014, and it's seen every version of Windows 10 since.

I believe Linux has a place in the VR scene. More importantly, I wanted to enable my friends to smile and laugh like I'm able to in VRChat. So, I set out to port VRCFaceTracking to Linux.

## Background

To the uninitiated, VRCFaceTracking describes itself as:

> (An) OSC App to allow VRChat avatars to interact with eye and facial tracking hardware.

Before getting my hands dirty, I looked around to see if anyone had done any relevant work prior to me. 

While I was able to find a project called [oscavmgr](https://github.com/galister/oscavmgr), I determined there wasn't anything out there with the features I was looking for. I wanted a version of the current desktop app to run on Linux, staying true to the original app as possible. With some quality-of-life improvements such as the ability to search for modules, custom themes, and so on.

## The Current Desktop App

VRCFaceTracking is divided into 3 sub-projects:

1) VRCFaceTracking
    - The "frontend" of the app. What you can see and touch, talks to the backend (below).
1) VRCFaceTracking.Core
    - The "backend" of the app. Handles all the business logic.
1) VRCFaceTracking.SDK
    - What modules implement to be recognized and loaded by VRCFaceTracking at runtime.

In other words, I only needed to recreate the first "VRCFaceTracking" project.

At this point as well, I needed to choose the .NET UI framework I'd be building the app with. I opted to use [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/), as I have used it before with [Babble.NET](https://github.com/Project-Babble/Babble.Net), and it's one of the best frameworks for making cross platform .NET applications (in my biased opinion).

Shoutout to [MamaMiaDev](https://www.mammamia.dev/) for their [amazing tutorial video series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mzM6N4drCU). They helped me understand Avalonia when things got confusing, and their code serves as the solid foundation for this project :)

## Crafting The Pages

Avalonia uses [AXAML](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/basics/user-interface/introduction-to-xaml), an xml-formatted markdown language to define UI elements. You can think of it as the HTML of a website. I started by defining the home, the output, then the module, the settings and then finally the mutator page in that order.

  "/blog/vrcft-avalonia/app-3.png",
  "/blog/vrcft-avalonia/app-4.png",
]} />

If you've WinUI3 before, you'll feel right at home with this. There isn't too much to write about here, this was mainly boilerplate code. 

This was, however, the easy part of the project.

## Issues With VRCFaceTracking.Core

With the frontend out of the way, I started to connect the bits and pieces of my new frontend to the backend, VRCFaceTracking.Core. I quickly ran into a number of issues:

### Pathing

This was by far the most common issue.

#### AvatarConfigFileParser.cs (L24):

Before:
```csharp
foreach (var avatarFile in Directory.GetFiles(userFolder + "\\Avatars"))
```

After:
```csharp
foreach (var avatarFile in Directory.GetFiles(Path.Combine(userFolder, "Avatars")))
```

#### Redirectors.cs (L34), Utils.cs (L34)

Before:
```csharp
public static readonly string CustomLibsDirectory = PersistentDataDirectory + "\\CustomLibs";
```

After:
```csharp
public static readonly string CustomLibsDirectory = Path.Combine(PersistentDataDirectory, "CustomLibs");
```

### Windows-Exclusive Functions

In `MainStandalone.cs L40`, `Utils.TimeEndPeriod()` is Windows exclusive.

In `ModuleInstaller.cs L68`, `RemoveZoneIdentifier()` applies only to files on Windows.

### fti_osc

VRCFaceTracking.Core uses an in-house rust library `fti_osc` to process OSC messages. I was able to compile this for macOS and Linux without issue, but proper marshalling needed to be included in the interop file.

Firstly, we need UTF-8 string formatting for marshalled strings on macOS and Linux. We can use `LPUTF8Str`, in place of the `LPStr` here, and this also works for Windows:

```csharp
[MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPUTF8Str)]
public string some_string_name;
```

Secondly, `fti_osc` needs a base dll name for cross-platform support:

```csharp
public static class fti_osc
{
    private const string DllName = "fti_osc";

    /// <summary>
    /// Parses a byte buffer of specified length into a single pointer to an osc message
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="buffer">The target byte buffer to parse osc from</param>
    /// <param name="bufferLength">The length of <paramref name="buffer"/></param>
    /// <param name="byteIndex">The index of the first byte of the message. This is modified after a message is parsed
    /// This way we can sequentially read messages by passing in the value this int was last modified to be</param>
    /// <returns>Pointer to an OscMessageMeta struct</returns>
    [DllImport(DllName, CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
    public static extern IntPtr parse_osc(byte[] buffer, int bufferLength, ref int byteIndex);

    /// <summary>
    /// Serializes a pointer to an OscMessageMeta struct into a 4096 length byte buffer
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="buf">Target write buffer</param>
    /// <param name="osc_template">Target OscMessageMeta to serialize</param>
    /// <returns>Amount of bytes written to <paramref name="buf"/></returns>
    [DllImport(DllName, CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
    public static extern int create_osc_message([MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPArray, SizeConst = 4096)] byte[] buf, ref OscMessageMeta osc_template);

    /// <summary>
    /// Serializes a pointer to an array of OscMessageMeta structs to a byte array of size 4096
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="buf">Target byte array</param>
    /// <param name="messages">Array of messages to be contained within the bundle</param>
    /// <param name="len">Length of <paramref name="messages"/></param>
    /// <param name="messageIndex">Index of the last message written to <paramref name="buf"/> before it was filled</param>
    /// <returns></returns>
    [DllImport(DllName, CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
    public static extern int create_osc_bundle(
        [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPArray, SizeConst = 4096)] byte[] buf,
        [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPArray)] OscMessageMeta[] messages,
        int len,
        ref int messageIndex);

    /// <summary>
    /// Free memory allocated to OscMessageMeta by fti_osc lib
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="oscMessage">Target message pointer</param>
    [DllImport(DllName, CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
    public static extern void free_osc_message(IntPtr oscMessage);
}
```

### Misc.

#### VRChat.VRCData

Logic was added to get the user's VRChat OSC folder on macOS/Linux machines:

Before:

```csharp
public static readonly string VRCData = Path.Combine($"{Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("localappdata")}Low", "VRChat\\VRChat");
```

After:

```csharp
static VRChat()
{
    // (Windows code remains the same)

    // On macOS/Linux, things are a little different. The above points to a non-existent folder
    // Thankfully, we can make some assumptions based on the fact VRChat on Linux runs through Proton

    // 1) First, get the user profile folder
    // (/home/USER_NAME/)
    var home = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.UserProfile);

    // 2) Then, search for common Steam install paths
    // (/home/USER_NAME/.steam/steam/)
    string[] possibleSteamPaths =
    [
        Path.Combine(home, ".steam", "steam"),
        Path.Combine(home, ".local", "share", "Steam"),
        Path.Combine(home, ".var", "app", "com.valvesoftware.Steam", ".local", "share", "Steam")
    ];
    var steamPath = Array.Find(possibleSteamPaths, Directory.Exists);
    var vrChatPath = string.Empty;

    // 3) Inside the steam install directory, find the file steamPath/steamapps/libraryfolders.vdf
    // This is a special file that tells us where on a users computer their steam libraries are
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(steamPath))
    {
        var steamLibrariesPaths = Path.Combine(steamPath!, "steamapps", "libraryfolders.vdf");
        dynamic volvo = VdfConvert.Deserialize(File.ReadAllText(steamLibrariesPaths));

        foreach (var library in volvo.Value)
        {
            if (library.Value["path"] == null || library.Value["apps"] == null)
            {
                continue;
            }

            string libraryPath = library.Value["path"].ToString();
            VObject apps = library.Value["apps"];

            // From this, determine which of all the libraries has the VRChat install via its AppID (438100)
            if (apps == null || !apps.ContainsKey("438100"))
            {
                continue;
            }

            vrChatPath = libraryPath;
            break;
        }
    }

    /* 4) Edge case! Here, if:
    A) VRChat was NOT detected OR
    B) VRChat was detected, BUT it's NOT running
    An avatar emulator might be trying to use us!
    For reference, here is what an emulator path looks like on MacOS. Gotta have variety:
    /Users/[user]/.local/share/VRChat/vrchat/OSC/
    We need to try this first before defaulting to the game path */
    string[] possibleEmulatorPaths =
    [
        Path.Combine(home, ".local", "share", "VRChat")
    ];
    var emulatorPath = Array.Find(possibleEmulatorPaths, Directory.Exists);
    var isVRChatInactive = string.IsNullOrEmpty(vrChatPath) || !IsVrChatRunning();

    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(emulatorPath) && isVRChatInactive)
    {
        // Construct the path to the avatar emulator's data folder
        VRCOSCDirectory = Path.Combine(emulatorPath, "vrchat", "OSC");
    }

    /* 5) Finally, construct the path to the user's VRChat install
    For reference, here is what a target path looks like:
    /home/USER_NAME/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/438100/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/LocalLow/VRChat/VRChat/OSC/
    Where 438100 is VRChat's Steam GameID, and the path after "steam" is pretty much fixed */
    else if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(vrChatPath))
    {
        VRCOSCDirectory = Path.Combine(vrChatPath, "steamapps", "compatdata", "438100", "pfx", "drive_c",
            "users", "steamuser", "AppData", "LocalLow", "VRChat", "VRChat", "OSC");
    }
}

public static string VRCOSCDirectory { get; }
```

#### Validator:

Uses of `Validator.TryValidateObject` in `OscRecvService.cs` and `OscSendService.cs` crash on macOS/Linux.

## Putting It All Together

A little bit of tinkering later, I had a functioning version of the app on my Windows PC. I used my app for a night to see how it would perform in VRChat, and it was able to keep up just fine.

### Bread Joins

On the second night of testing a friend of mine, Bread, joined on me in VRChat's screen mode. He was eager to show me something he was working on:

![bread-screenshot-1](/blog/vrcft-avalonia/bread-screenshot-1.png)

![bread-screenshot-2](/blog/vrcft-avalonia/bread-screenshot-2.png)

A fresh install of Arch riced to look just like Windows 7? Very nice.

Anyways, I tell him about the app I'm working on and offer to send him a copy. At this point I had built and run a copy of the app on my craptop (I use mint btw). 

He said sure, and I sent him a copy of the app. It booted up just fine, so he said he would get into VR to try out some of the modules.

One install of [ALVR](https://github.com/alvr-org/alvr) later, the app crashed. But it wasn't with ALVR or its module: I took a look at his log file and determined the app looking for VRChat's OSC in the wrong place! 

So I quickly hardcoded Bread's path into the app, threw it on Proton Drive, and eagerly waited for him to download it:

```
/home/toast/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/438100/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/LocalLow/VRChat/VRChat/OSC/
```

And it worked! Here's Bread with eye and face tracking, in VRChat, on Arch!

## Packaging
So, with a working app we need a way to get it in the hands of people. I wrote a python script that builds and packages the desktop app to .zip files. Currently we have `x64` and `arm64` builds for Windows, macOS and Linux. Other builds are possible too, if and when needs be I can update the script. Here is the code: 

```python
import os
import shutil
import subprocess
import glob

def run_dotnet_publish(runtime, config, self_contained, framework):
    """Run the dotnet publish command with the specified parameters."""
    cmd = [
        'dotnet', 'publish',
        '-r', runtime,
        '-c', config,
        '--self-contained' if self_contained else '',
        '-f', framework
    ]
    cmd = [part for part in cmd if part]  # Remove empty strings
    print(f"Running: {' '.join(cmd)}")
    subprocess.run(cmd, check=True)

def create_zip(source_dir, zip_name):
    """Create a zip file from the specified directory."""
    # Create zip file
    if os.path.exists(zip_name):
        os.remove(zip_name)

    # Check if directory has content
    if not os.listdir(source_dir):
        print(f"Warning: Directory {source_dir} is empty, skipping zip creation")
        return False

    shutil.make_archive(
        base_name=zip_name[:-4],  # Remove .zip extension
        format='zip',
        root_dir=source_dir,
        base_dir='./'
    )
    print(f"Created: {zip_name}")
    return True

def find_output_directory(bin_dir, framework, runtime):
    """Find the directory containing the published output for a specific framework and runtime."""
    # For Windows-specific frameworks
    if framework.startswith('net') and 'windows' in framework.lower():
        # Convert framework format to directory format (replace - with .)
        dir_framework = framework.replace('-', '.')

        # Check for direct match first
        publish_dir = os.path.join(bin_dir, dir_framework, runtime, 'publish')
        if os.path.exists(publish_dir) and os.listdir(publish_dir):
            return publish_dir

        # Try alternative paths for windows frameworks
        # First try with dots instead of dashes
        alt_path = os.path.join(bin_dir, framework.replace('-', '.'), runtime, 'publish')
        if os.path.exists(alt_path) and os.listdir(alt_path):
            return alt_path

        # Then try with just the base framework (net8.0)
        base_framework = framework.split('-')[0]
        alt_path = os.path.join(bin_dir, base_framework, runtime, 'publish')
        if os.path.exists(alt_path) and os.listdir(alt_path):
            return alt_path
    else:

        publish_dir = os.path.join(bin_dir, framework, runtime, 'publish')
        if os.path.exists(publish_dir) and os.listdir(publish_dir):
            return publish_dir

    # If we couldn't find it with the specific approaches, do a more general search
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(bin_dir):
        if root.endswith(os.path.join(runtime, 'publish')) and os.listdir(root):
            return root

    return None

```

## The Future 

### Installers

Up next, I want to create installers for Windows, macOS and Linux. I've started work on using [`pup-net`](https://github.com/kuiperzone/PupNet-Deploy), a tool that builds and creates installers with one script.

I could also take the Babble App approach that [curls down a bash script](https://gist.github.com/dfgHiatus/e1bce63cd6be1e8645c3b3adfd5b71a6), runs that and adds `vrcft` as a path-invokable terminal command. If you know of any other tools, please let me know!

### Localization

Another thing I want to add is localization for the app. For reference, [the Babble App has been translated into over 12 languages](https://crowdin.com/project/project-babble-locale/translations) thanks to the help of our amazing community and Crowdin. 

VRCFaceTracking has been translated into 5, and it doesn't come bundled with a language selector. To this end, I've created [an unofficial Crowdin page](https://crowdin.com/project/vrcfacetracking-unofficial) for this, and translations here are directly applicable to both our app as well as the original app.

### Mobile Builds?!

The starter project contained some sample code to make the app run on Android. With some more tweaking it would be *possible* to port things to Android and iOS. No promises!

### The Github

If you want to check out the code for this project we have it here! We also have downloads there as well, feel free to snag a copy: https://github.com/dfgHiatus/VRCFaceTracking.Avalonia/

That does it for me here. I'll keep y'all posted:
