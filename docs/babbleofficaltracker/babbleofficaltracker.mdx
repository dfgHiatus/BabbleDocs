# Official Babble Tracker

Hi there! If you're in this section, you've purchaced a Babble Mouth Tracker V1! 

## Here's how to use the tracker:

### 1) Plug your tracker into your PC! 
    - This is pretty simple! There is a USB C port on your tracker! Plug it in and you should hear a windows connection sound when plugged in!
    - IMPORTANT: Make sure the switch is in the "ON" position! (see image below)
    - There should be two very bright green lights on the back of the trackers!

### 2) Look at device manager for the COM port of the tracker!
    -  Press the windows key, then type "Device Manager" and press enter.
    - In the device manager, look for "Ports (COM & LPT)" and expand it.
    - You should see a new COM port listed under "Ports (COM & LPT)" listed as "USB Serial Device". This is the COM port of your tracker.
