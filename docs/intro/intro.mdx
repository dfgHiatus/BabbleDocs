## What is Project Babble?

**Project Babble** is a **lower-face expression tracking system** designed specifically for VR headsets. It uses camera input to capture and interpret facial expressions, which can then be integrated into external applications such as VRCFaceTracking and Resonite mods.

Our goal with Project Babble is to create a versatile system that is both **hardware and OS independent**. This means it supports a variety of camera hardware and is compatible with both Windows and Linux operating systems.
