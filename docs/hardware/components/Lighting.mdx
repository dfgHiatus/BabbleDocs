For Project Babble, you can use either Infrared or visible light. Each has its advantages and considerations:

- **Infrared Lighting:**
  - Less distracting as the light is not visible to the naked eye.
  - Susceptible to flicker from base stations if not sufficiently bright.

- **Visible Lighting:**
  - Immune to base station flicker.
  - Potential for distraction if the headset doesn't block light effectively.

Consider these factors when choosing the type of lighting for your setup

### Additional Note About Voltage
Either 3.3V or 5V can be used to power the LEDs, however the resistors used will be different. 5V can only be used when powered over USB while 3.3V can be used with both USB and battery power.
