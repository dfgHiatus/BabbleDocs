# Headset Not Listed?

If you don't see your headset listed, you will either have to find a mount elseware for your headset or you can make your own. Many headsets already have a mount created for the Vive Facial Tracker. These can be adapted to use the general components. 

If you would like to share your design, feel free to contribute to these docs and add your mount to the list!
