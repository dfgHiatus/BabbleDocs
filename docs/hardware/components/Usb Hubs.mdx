# USB Hubs

- **1x USB 3.0+ Hub**
  - The hub should support **Multi-TT (MTT)** if you plan to use other high-bandwidth devices along with the ESPs. **Single-TT (STT)** hubs may work if they are only used with ESP devices (e.g., Babble + ETVR).
  - Ensure the hub is of good quality, lightweight, compact, and has at least three portsâ€”one for the face tracker and two for the ESP32-S3 boards.
  - [Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)

- **USB-A to USB-C Adapters**
  - Make sure to have the necessary adapters if required. For instance, the Valve Index only has one USB-A port.
  - [Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)

- **1x USB-C Cables** (as short as possible) to connect both ESPs.
  - Since the ESP32-S3 uses USB-C connectors, you might need USB-C to USB-A cables, depending on your USB hub configuration.

:::warning
**Note:** USB hubs are not required if you only plan on using Projet Babble, you might need a USB hub if you also plan on using for example: [EyeTrackVR](https://docs.eyetrackvr.dev/).
