# Wiring Guide

Follow these steps to wire LEDs to the Seeed XIAO ESP32-S3 safely and effectively:

- **Power Options for LEDs**:
  - Either **3.3V** or **5V** can be used to power the LEDs.
  - **3.3V** is compatible with both USB and battery power.
  - **5V** can only be used when the ESP32 is powered via USB.

- **Resistor Requirements**:
  - For **3.3V** power: Use **82-ohm resistors** in series with the LEDs.
  - For **5V** power: Use **160-ohm resistors** in series with the LEDs.

- **Steps to Wire the LEDs**:
  1. Connect the **GND pin** on the ESP32 to the cathode (short leg) of the LED.
  2. Add an appropriate resistor (82 ohms for 3.3V, 160 ohms for 5V) in series with the anode (long leg) of the LED.
  3. Connect the other end of the resistor to either:
     - **3.3V pin** (if using 3.3V power), or
     - **5V pin** (if using 5V power).
  4. Repeat the process for additional LEDs, ensuring each has its own resistor.

- **Important Notes**:
  - Do not connect LEDs directly to the ESP32 pins without a resistor, as it may damage the LEDs or the microcontroller.
  - Ensure the ESP32 is correctly powered based on your selected voltage (USB or battery).
