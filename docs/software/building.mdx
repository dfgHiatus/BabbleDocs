# Running the source code

This page covers how to download and run the source code for the Babble App. It only takes 5 minutes!

## 1) Prerequisites

To get started, you will need to install:

- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Windows

If you're on on Windows, you'll also need to download:
- [`pyenv-win`](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win)

### Other Operating Systems

For other Operating Systems:
- [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

## 1) Downloading the Babble App

Navigate to a folder where you would like to install the Babble App.

Then, open a terminal in your folder. Make sure its current directory matches the folder!

Now, run this command to download the Babble App to the folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/Project-Babble/ProjectBabble.git
```

# 2) Downloading Python

Now, we need to install a version of Python the Babble App is compatible with.

<details>
  <summary>For reference, here is a compatibility table of the Babble App and different versions of Python.</summary>

| < 3.7 | 3.8 | 3.9 | 3.10 | 3.11 | 3.12 | 3.13 |
|:------:|:---:|:---:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|    ❌   |  ⚠️  |  ⚠️  |   ✅  |   ✅  |   ✅  |   ❌  |

:::danger
In theory, the Babble App *may* work on versions of Python as low as 3.5. We cannot guarantee its stability these versions, proceed at your own risk if you do!
:::

:::warning
With the upcoming addition of Vive Facial Tracker support to the Babble App, the lowest version of Python supported going into the future will be 3.10.  
:::

:::note
Python `3.13` support is planned once key dependencies are built against `3.13`, namely `onnxruntime-directml` and `onnxruntime-gpu`.
:::
</details>

:::info
We recommend Python version `3.12.8`. We'll use it for this tutorial!
:::

In the same terminal, run:

```
pyenv init
```

If applicable, follow the instructions the above command outputs.

Once you have done that, in the same terminal as above, run:

```
pyenv install 3.12.8
pyenv global 3.12.8
```

This will set the global version of Python in your machine. If you ever need to change it, you can run the last command above with a different version.

## 3) Setting up 

Now, in the same terminal as above, run:

### Windows

```
cd BabbleApp
python -m venv venv
./venv/bin/activate.ps1
```

### Other Operating Systems:

```
cd BabbleApp
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

This creates a [virtual environment](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/) which is used to store the Babble App's dependencies. Now run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And wait for `pip` to install everything. This might take some time!

## 4) Running the Babble App

Finally, you are ready to run the Babble App! Run:

```
python babbleapp.py
```

## 5) Subsequent Runs

For subsequent runs, you will need to activate the virtual environment prior to running the Babble App. 

You can do this by running the *last line* in [Step 3](building#3-setting-up) in tandem with the command from [Step 4](building#4-running-the-babble-app), making sure your terminal window is in the same location as it was before.

:::info
Make sure you are in your `BabbleApp` folder prior to running these, or they will not work!
:::

### Windows

```
./venv/bin/activate.ps1
python babbleapp.py
```

### Other Operating Systems:

```
source venv/bin/activate
python babbleapp.py
```

That's it!
