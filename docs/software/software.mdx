## Expressions Tracked

Project Babble outputs a subset of [Unified Expressions](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/tutorial-avatars/tutorial-avatars-extras/unified-blendshapes). You can read more about these expressions and [their mappings here](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/tutorial-avatars/tutorial-avatars-extras/compatibility/overview).
