# Notes on Linux

## The Babble App

### v4l2/v4l-utils

If you receive a `["Error listing UVC devices on Linux ... No such file or directory"]` when choosing/changing your camera, you'll need to install video4linux (`v4l-utils`) for your distro.

For Ubuntu or other distros with apt:
```bash
sudo apt-get install v4l-utils
``` 

---

### tkinter

If you receive a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'` error message on run, you'll need to install `tkinter` for your distro.

For Ubuntu or other distros with apt:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
For Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
```

You can read more about this [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25905540/importerror-no-module-named-tkinter).

### udev

If you have trouble connecting to your Babble Board (IE being denied permission to access it), you will need to set up and configure [udev](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/udev-rules.html) rules.

## Desktop Environments

### KDE Plasma

If your GUI window shows just the top row of buttons, set a resolution for the Babble App manually in KDE's Window Settings. 800x600y is a good starting point with plenty of empty space.

### Cinammon

No graphical issues have been reported with the client on Cinammon.

### XCFE

No graphical issues have been reported with the client on XCFE.

## Building from source

If building from source, you will need to remove the line `onnxruntime-directml==X.XX.X` from the `requirements.txt` file inside the `BabbleApp` folder.
