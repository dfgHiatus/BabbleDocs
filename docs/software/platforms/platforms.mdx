| Platform | Compatibility | Notes |
|----------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows                          | ✅            | -                                                                                                             |
| [MacOS](platforms/macos)         | ✅            | Desktop Notifications do not work on MacOS. This does not impact other parts of the Babble App.               |
| [Linux](platforms/linux)         | ✅            | While the Babble App has been tested on Linux there are some DE specific quirks, notably in KDE Plasma.       |
